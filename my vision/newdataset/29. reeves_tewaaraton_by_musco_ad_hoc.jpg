		<h3>ABOUT THE NEW REGULATION</h3>

		<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all companies, including businesses located in the United States and Canada, who process any information about EU citizens. It is global in reach and introduces a new, broader definition of what &lsquo;personal information&rsquo; means.</p>

		<p>The GDPR aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.</p>
